## Roll no:
EP22B002

## Current PORs:
Mentor @ Avanti

## Why I want to work in the team:
Abhiyaan is an amazing team that does actual practical innovation that can be implemented in real life and be actally beneficial for common people(unlike a racecar or a levitating pod or a sounding rocket). I feel that Abhiyaaan and its culture provides a plethora of new learning opportunities and an amazing place to showcase my talents. In essence, I see a lot of real innovation and implementation happening in this team and am fully ready to put in all my time to be a part of this.
